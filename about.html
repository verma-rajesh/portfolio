            What does this mean? Well, I didn’t get into nutrition for the food.
            I got into it because of the people. I didn’t go down the typical
            path as a dieitian. I have always been interested in psychology and
            helping those who didn’t know how to help themselves. This led me to
            my enriching work as a nutritional counselor with the eating
            disorder population. By creating a safe space for my patients to
            share their stories, I provided realistic solutions that empowered
            them to enact change within themselves.

            I’ve traveled all over the world but have a stong affinity for the
            French people and their culture. I spent a few months learning the
            language and getting to know the people. I find the French have an
            eye for style and design, and they are not afraid to push perceived
            fashion limitations. I find joy in this visual culture and have used
            it to inspire my own designs: minimilistic with an edge.

            As a designer, it is important to be able to paint a story for
            others. The Harry Potter series still to this day invokes vivid and
            imaginative imagery (yes, I re-read this series often). I still feel
            elated when Harry gets his letter to Hogwarts; I feel pain when
            Dobby dies, and I feel hope as each year the three friends defeat
            Voldermort. Painting a picture, sketching an idea, and evoking a
            feeling are all things that are neccessary as an effective UX
            designer.
