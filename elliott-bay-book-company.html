                The goal of this project was to redesign a section of the
                “Elliott Bay Book Store” based on user needs. This was an
                individual project however, I had a classmate help take notes
                while I interviewed real users at the bookstore. I had two weeks
                to complete the task.

                After talking with Elliott Bay users and doing some online
                research, I discovered that the major competitors of Elliott Bay
                included Amazon and Barnes and Nobles. I also included some

                Books” and “Arundel Books”. I conducted an element analysis and

                Elliott Bay Bookstore has one of the largest book selections if
                not the largest within Seattle, however with the current state
                of the website, there was no way to compete with the web
                presence of larger brands. This doesn’t mean that I wasn’t going
                to do my best to improve the current state of the bookstore in
                order to improve the user experience and increase profit margins
                for a well liked local bookstore. It was time to continue down
                the UX proccess with some user testing on the original website.

                I chose Daniella after visiting “Elliott Bay” and getting a feel
                for the demographic that shopped at their store. After observing
                customers, talking to staff members, and interviewing users, I
                discovered that there is a wide range of people that shop at the
                bookstore. So I decided to dig into the website and see what the
                major UX issues were. What I discovered was that the website was
                hard to navigate and that the global navigation was unclearly
                labeled. Furthermore, the book category list was overwhelmingly
                long. This information lead me to choose Daniella as my target
                user. Some of her major needs include a simple layout with clear
                choices, suggestions based on past purchases, a simple checkout,
                and having a person to contact for help.

              <dd class="experience-explanation">
                Daniella is buying a fantasy book for her teenage grandson’s
                birthday. She likes Elliott Bay Book Company because she enjoys
                supporting local shops. She opens the home page and is
                immediately confused by the page’s layout and poor navigation.
                She tries to search for genres using the search bar but gets
                stuck in a loop of searching for keywords and receiving
                unrelated book titles. She eventually discovers the “Shop”
                button is a link that will take her to a “Browse Books” section
                button but she is met with a list of 52 subjects and unrelated
                books. When she tries to refine her search, she is again
                overwhelmed by the number of book categories she must sort
                through to find the right subject and book. This leads to
                frustration and early website abandonment.

                  I gave users 5 tasks. The first task was to find a genre that
                  would take them to Dragons. The second task was to refine
                  their search, the third to choose a book, the fourth to add it
                  to cart, and finally, the fifth task was to check out.

                  Using information from the card sort, I started with “Browse
                  and Buy” as the drop down where users could find book
                  categories. What I found was that this was not as intuitive as
                  I had hoped for. Users struggled with finding genres and also
                  had some difficulty refining their search. So I tested “Books”
                  next based on user Feedback.

                  I realised that my problem was not just the lack of an

                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to refined categorization, not only does a “Browse
                  By Category” feature need to exist, it needs to be clearly
                  labeled in order to effectively communicate its purpose to the
                  user.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I iterated on the naming convention one final time with the
                  feedback that users wanted a very clearly labeled path to
                  search genres. The new link name I used was “Explore Genres”.
