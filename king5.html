                This was a three person team group project. The purpose of this
                project was to create a new feature for the assigned app. We
                received the King5 news app. We had two weeks to conduct
                interviews, gather data, create mockups and deliver a
                presentation.

                I was the interaction designer and the competitive research lead
                for this project. This means that I helped write interview
                questions to zero in on the competition, evaluated the feedback,
                and created wireframes based on existing branding and user
                needs.

                Paper and pen were used to create the initial wireframes which
                were then captured in “Pop by Marvel” to create a more realistic
                process for testing. Sketch was used to create the wireframes.
                And InVision brought the high fidelity wireframes to life for
                the final rounds of testing.

                It was neccessary to conduct a competitive and heuristic
                evaluation on the news apps that came back in our user surveys
                as favorites (CNN, NPR, Seattle Times). The analysis of the
                three apps helped me to better understand how these industry
                experts layed out their products for users. I then compared the
                findings to the King 5 app.
