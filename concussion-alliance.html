                The redesign was created based on the persona, Hailey’s need for
                a cleaner layout and accessibilty. This design also took into
                account the client’s mission, the tested wireframes, color
                theory, and readability.

                The “Treatments” and “Medical Care” pages demonstrates how
                visuals were introduced to help users navigate the text. A
                generous use of white space allows for a decrease in cognitive
                load. There are subtle uses of the color palette in throughout
                the visuals to demonstrate continuity.
