                The “Treatments” and “Medical Care” pages demonstrates how
                visuals were introduced to help users navigate the text. Furthermore, a
                generous use of white space allows for a decrease in cognitive
                load. In addition, there are subtle uses of the color palette throughout
                the imagess to demonstrate continuity.
